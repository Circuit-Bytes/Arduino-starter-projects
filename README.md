# Arduino Starter Projects

A collection of beginner-friendly **Arduino projects** built and simulated using [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/).  
This repository documents my first steps into **electronics, coding, and embedded systems**, with hands-on practice using Arduino UNO.

Each folder contains:
- `.ino` file with the Arduino code
- README.md explaining the logic
- Circuit diagram 



## Project List

| No. |      Project Name          |               Description                    |
|-----|  ------------------------  | ------------------------------------------   |
| 01  | Blink an LED               | Turns an LED ON/OFF with 1-second delay      |
| 02  | Pattern blinking           | Blinks LEDs in various patterns              |
| 03  | Button-controlled LED      | LED turns ON only while button is pressed    |
| 04  | Toggle LED                 | LED toggles ON/OFF with every button press   |
| 05  | Buzzer with Button         | Buzzer buzzes and led blinks on button press |
| 06  | LED Fading                 | Smooth fade using PWM and `analogWrite()`    |
| 07  | Potentiometer Brightness   | Controls LED brightness via analog input     |
| 08  | Potentiometer Blink Speed  | Varies blink rate with potentiometer         |
| 09  | Traffic Light System       | Simulates a 3-light traffic controller       |



## Skills Practiced

- Digital input/output (`digitalWrite`, `digitalRead`)
- Timing with `delay()`
- Analog input (`analogRead`)
- PWM output (`analogWrite`)
- State toggling & condition checks
- Circuit simulation with Tinkercad




##  Tools Used

- [Tinkercad Circuits](https://www.tinkercad.com/)
- Arduino UNO
- VS Code / Arduino IDE (for code editing)



## About This Repo

This repository is a part of my learning journey into **electronics and embedded systems**.  
I'm documenting everything from simple LED blinking to interactive circuits to develop clarity and confidence.
